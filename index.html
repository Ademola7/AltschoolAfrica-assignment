      <h2 class="sub-headings">Why Alschool?</h2>
      <ol>
        <li class="why">
          <span>Flexibility:</span> Altschool allow learners to study from
          anywhere, which means you can balance your education with other
          commitments like work or family. This flexibility often extends to the
          pace of the course as well, accommodating different learning speeds.
        </li>
        <li class="why">
          <span>Cost-Effectiveness:</span> Altschool is quite affordable than
          their counterparts.
        </li>
        <li class="why">
          <span>Diverse Access:</span> Participants can join from anywhere in
          the world, increasing access to high-quality education regardless of
          geographic location. This also often means exposure to a broader range
          of perspectives and networking opportunities.
        </li>
        <li class="why">
          <span>Self-Paced Options:</span> Many remote bootcamps offer
          self-paced learning options, allowing students to progress through
          material at a rate that works best for them, which can lead to a
          deeper understanding and retention of the material.
        </li>
        <li class="why">
          <span>Reduced Commute and Relocation Costs:</span> Eliminating the
          need to travel to a physical location saves time and money. It also
          removes the need for relocation, which can be a significant barrier
          for some learners.
